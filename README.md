# Project Name: Go Microservices and Kubernetes 

## Overview
This project comprises several small, independent microservices designed to communicate with each other and a basic front-end application. The communication channels include REST API, RPC via gRPC.

## Features
- **Modularity**: Each microservice functions independently, promoting scalability and maintainability.
- **Loose Coupling**: Services interact via standardized communication protocols, minimizing dependencies.
- **Scalability**: Microservices architecture allows for easy scaling of individual components based on demand.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple communication methods, accommodating diverse use cases.

## Future Plans
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Integration with Kubernetes for containerized deployment and orchestration.
